- Hey, there! I'm Kara and I'm a user experiencer researcher studying at Carnegie Mellon University's Master of Human Computer Interaction program. 
- I'm interested in creating dynamic digital experiences that bring creativity and user empathy to the forefront.
- I'm just starting out with my development skills, so there's a lot I'll have to learn and I'm always on the hunt for leasons and tips.
